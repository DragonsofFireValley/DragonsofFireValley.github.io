			Welcome to Dragons of Fire Valley!
		</h1>
		<br />
		<h3>Who are we?</h3>
		<p>The Dragons of Fire Valley was formed in 2007 in Chehalis, Washington.</p>
		<p>The land started with three people searching for a new home. Finding a land rich with tree's and resources in Washington, they had found a new area to set up home.</p>
		<p>Voting and making it official, the land started its long journey towards prosperity, and are growing constantly each year.</p>
		<p>Finding a solid support structure within the Northern Lights, the Dragons of Fire Valley have become hosts to several large scale travel days and provide a great group of people for future growth of the Northern Lights and Dragons of Fire Valley itself.</p><br />
		
		<h3>How Can I Join?</h3>
		<p>It's actually quite simple to join! You can join by coming out to a "Park day" and say hi. There you would fill out a waiver and "bing, bang, boom" you're a member. We can't wait to see you. &lpar;:</p>

		<h4>What if I don't live in the area?</h4>
		<p>That's unfortunate, but there is nothing we can do about that. However, there is an option! Amtgard has a wide multitude of lands all over the world. Need to see which is best for you? <a href="https://ork.amtgard.com/orkui/index.php?Route=Atlas" target="_blank">Take a look!</a></p>
		
		<h3>What do I need?</h3>
		<p>Yourself! That's it! Usually there is what we call "Loaner Weapons" which are weapons that people are allowed to fight with temporary. If you find yourself interested past that, we can help teach you how to make weapons. &lpar;:</p>

		<h3>What can I do next?</h3>
		<p>Come on out! We are always happy to meet new people. We hope you enjoy Amtgard as much as we do!</p>
